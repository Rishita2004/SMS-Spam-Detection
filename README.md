# SMS-Spam-Detection
Spam Detection using Machine Learning is a project aimed at building an efficient spam classifier using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project leverages a diverse set of classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Neighbours, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to accurately identify and classify spam and non-spam messages.
